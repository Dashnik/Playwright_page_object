# ðŸ§© Page Object Pattern with Playwright & TypeScript

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project demonstrates the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern using TypeScript and Playwright.
It serves as a foundation for building maintainable, scalable, and readable UI test automation frameworks.

## Getting Started
To set up this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
3. Set up Playwright browsers:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install --with-deps   
4. Launch tests:
    ```bash
    npx playwright test  
   
## Future Plans

Adding tests into CI/CD

Set up a linter, Prettier, and Husky for consistent code quality and formatting.

Add API testing alongside UI tests.

Store authentication keys securely in storageState or other locations supported by Playwright.

Including reusable patterns directly in this repository.

Implement fixture for BasePage and HomePage
