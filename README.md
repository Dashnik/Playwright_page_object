# Page Object Pattern

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Page Object Model pattern with example spec and page files using TypeScript and Playwright.  
It provides a foundation for building maintainable and scalable UI tests.

## Getting Started
To set up this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install

## Future Plans

Add API testing alongside UI tests.

Store authentication keys securely in storageState or other locations supported by Playwright.

Set up a linter, Prettier, and Husky for consistent code quality and formatting.

Including reusable patterns directly in this repository.

Implement fixture for BasePage and HomePage
