# üß© Page Object Pattern with Playwright & TypeScript

## üìò Overview

This project demonstrates the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern using TypeScript and Playwright.
It serves as a foundation for building maintainable, scalable, and readable UI test automation frameworks.

## üöÄ Future Plans

- [x] Integrating tests into GitHub Actions as part of Continuous Integration.

- [ ] Set up a Prettier, tsconfig, linter and Husky for consistent code quality and formatting.

- [ ] Add API testing alongside UI tests.
