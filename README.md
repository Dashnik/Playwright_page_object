# Page Object Pattern

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Page Object Model pattern with example spec and page files using TypeScript and Playwright.  
It provides a foundation for building maintainable and scalable UI tests.

## Getting Started
To set up this project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
3. Set up Playwright browsers:
    ```bash
    npx playwright install --with-deps   

## Future Plans
Adding tests into CI/CD

Set up a linter, Prettier, and Husky for consistent code quality and formatting.

Add API testing alongside UI tests.

Store authentication keys securely in storageState or other locations supported by Playwright.

Including reusable patterns directly in this repository.

Implement fixture for BasePage and HomePage
